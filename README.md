# Linear-Regression-Application

A company in New York has sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions.
Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want. 
The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.

In this I used:
Pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
Simple Linear Regression
